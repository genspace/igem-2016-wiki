Integrated Human Practices (Ellen)
	designed tardigrade crispr not by expressing dircetly cas9
	ie assembled the whole complex invitro (no gene drive)

Improve a previous part or project
	qPCR 
		charaterize plasmid http://parts.igem.org/Part:pSB1C3

		Tomorrow Day
			fresh cultures 
			gather more replicates & test against dilutions
			every hour sample and  measure OD 600
			lysced based on paper in drive
		Tomorrow night
			round of qPCR's 

Proof of concept
	lea expression in ecoli 
	we have results but no data from the expression 
	(Show protein difference for band)

Demonstrate your work
	showed extend the life of a dried ecoli 
	proof would be in long term stability 
	but in short term stability 
	(Dry for presentation) 

============

- Go back to judging form make sure it links 
- put bold criteria summary at top of pages 

=============

-create survey for t-shirt 
	male female
	tshirt size 
	name
- email ali to find out if we should unisex 
	- timeframe for ordering

============
Email stony prof about injection 
Try knock out


Email the group and ask about group Photos and generally photos.


Bacgkround (Describe tardigrades) 
	blah blah blah cryptobiosis

Describe the two parts of the project
	Take proteins from tardigrades to see if they confer any resistance to draught 
		How we identified the proteins we want target 

		lea proteins synthesized put into ecoli showed 

	To evaluate the ease in which tardigrades could be used as a developmental model using Crispr cas 9 gene knockouts
		Maginashi Knocked out 

repeat w/ 
	Cas9 
 	Solution alone
 	Dye
